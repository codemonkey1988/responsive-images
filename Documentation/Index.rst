Extension for TYPO3 that adds the option to define centralized
configurations for picture tags and render them using Fluid ViewHelpers.
Configurations are defined using TypoScript.

About this extension
====================

This extension is based on the fact, that the integrator forces image sizes that
the content editor may not change. An integrator can specify image configurations
that are used in Fluid templates.
